# Descriptions: This is a card drawing simulation program.
### The official claimed odds of winning an SSR card are as follows:  
> 1. The chance of drawing an SSR card is 2%, which remains the same until the 50th draw.  
> 2. From the 50th draw, if one SSR card is not drawn, the chance of winning an SSR card in the next draw will increase by 0.5%.  
> 3. If one doesn't draw an SSR card before the 90th draw, then it will draw one on the 90th draw.  
> 4. Once the SSR card is drawn, the chance will be reset to the first rule.
